# Travel Agency Management System
This repository contains the code for the implementation of a Java-based travel agency management system with intuitive GUI and integration with MySQL for efficient operations. The graphical user interface was built using NetBeans's GUI Builder and the connection and interaction with the MySQL database was made thanks to the use of the JDBC API.
